App Concept: “Mood Pop!”

Description:
A light-hearted app that shows a surprise mood message or goofy daily pep talk each time you tap a big bubble icon. It’s like a digital “mood popper.” There’s no storage or backend—just an array of silly, encouraging, or weird messages coded in. The user taps → bubble pops with an animation → a mood or pep talk appears.

Specific Plan:
    •    Person A: Builds the home screen with a big bubble graphic. Adds tap detection.
    •    Person B: Adds the array of moods/pep talks. Handles random selection and displaying the message.
    •    Person C: Adds a popping animation and a silly sound effect (SwiftUI’s built-in audio or simple system sound).

How to Build:
    1.    Create ContentView with an Image or Circle representing the “bubble.”
    2.    Add onTapGesture to trigger NavigationLink or show a Sheet.
    3.    Show a random mood message from an array when bubble is tapped.
    4.    Add withAnimation for pop effect (scale down, fade, etc.).
    5.    Add a sound effect if time allows (AVFoundation or basic system sound).

Example Message:
    •    “You’re secretly a superhero today. Act accordingly.”
    •    “Your inner sloth says: nap is good.”
    •    “Dance break: 5 seconds. Go!”

Bonus:
Let each teammate write 5–10 funny messages. No need for local storage—hardcode them.

Demo Line:
“Tap the bubble, pop your stress—get a goofy mood boost.”
